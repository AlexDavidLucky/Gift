/**
  A data structure representing an index, also referred to as

  of the entire repository. The index captures a version of the
  projectâ€™s overall structure at some moment in time.

  The index allows a separation between incremental developmental
  changes and the committal of those changes. Changes are "staged"
  in an index, keeping those changes until they are ready to be
  committed.
